Work in progress...


Using ngrok to tunnel multiple host. The arduino code needs to be modified for the img src link. 
It needs to be the domain for the web cam server. If it remains local, it will not appear for people who visit.



What next:
# Plan to fix and style the html page with css.
# Need to pay for ngrok pro so I can tunnel multiple hosts and have the web cam work live
# Need to speed up requests, takes about 1.5 seconds per request sent to servo.
